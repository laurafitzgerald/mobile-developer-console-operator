= Mobile Developer Console - Standard Operating Procedures

:toc:
toc::[]

== Overview

The following guide outlines the steps required to manage and solve issues in the https://github.com/aerogear/mobile-developer-console[Mobile Developer Console] which is managed, installed and configured via the https://github.com/aerogear/mobile-developer-console-operator[Mobile Developer Console Operator].

== Reference Articles

- https://github.com/aerogear/mobile-developer-console[Mobile Developer Console]
- https://github.com/aerogear/mobile-developer-console-operator[Mobile Developer Console Operator]
- https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/alerting/[Prometheus Alerts documentation]

== Success Indicators

All alerts should appear as green in the Prometheus Alert Monitoring.

== Prometheus Alerts Procedures

IMPORTANT: Before checking any of following steps see if the operator pod is running successfully. More info: link:./SOP-operator.adoc[MobileDeveloperConsoleOperatorDown]

TIP: You can save the logs by running `oc logs <podname> > <filename>.log`. The logs can provided to you useful information in order to identify the root cause of the issue as they are required information to be send to its maintainers in the case it need to be checked by them.

=== Critical

==== MobileDeveloperConsoleDown or MobileDeveloperConsoleContainerDown

. Switch to the Mobile Developer Console namespace by running `oc project <namespace>`. E.g `oc project mobile-developer-console`.
. Follow the <<Validate>> steps.

. Verify the MobileDeveloperConsole is deployed in the same namespace as the operator.
.. Run `oc get MobileDeveloperConsole`
+
Expected results:
----
$ oc project mobile-developer-console
$ oc get MobileDeveloperConsole
NAME          PHASE
example-mdc
----

. Verify that the OAuthProxy Container is running successfully.
+
.. Run `oc logs <service-podname> -c mdc-oauth-proxy`. E.g `oc logs example-mdc-1-8m5ql -c mdc-oauth-proxy`
+

Logs should include the following:
+
----
2019/08/01 09:39:04 oauthproxy.go:201: mapping path "/" => upstream "http://localhost:4000/"
2019/08/01 09:39:04 oauthproxy.go:228: OAuthProxy configured for  Client ID: mobile-developer-console
2019/08/01 09:39:04 oauthproxy.go:238: Cookie settings: name:_oauth_proxy secure(https):true httponly:false expiry:168h0m0s domain:<default> refresh:disabled
2019/08/01 09:39:04 http.go:56: HTTP: listening on 0.0.0.0:4180
----
+

.. If alternative logs are found in the above step then save the logs by running `oc logs <service-podname> -c mdc-oauth-proxy > <filename>.log`

=== Warning

==== MobileDeveloperConsolePodCPUHigh

This alert indicates that the Service pod(s) is/are using more CPU than expected.

. Please follow the <<To capture the logs>> procedure in order to capture the required information to send it to its maintainers.
. Please follow the <<To scale the pod>> procedure in order to try to solve performance issues.

==== MobileDeveloperConsolePodMemoryHigh

This alert indicates that the Service pod(s) is/are using more Memory than expected.

. Please follow the <<To capture the logs>> procedure in order to capture the required information to send it to its maintainers.
. Please follow the <<To scale the pod>> procedure in order to try to solve performance issues.


==== To capture the logs

. Capture a snapshot of the 'Mobile Developer Console Application' Grafana dashboard and track it over time. The metrics can be useful for identifying performance issues over time.
. Capture the Service logs
.. Get the pod names by running `oc get pods`
.. Save the logs by running `oc logs <mdc-podname> > <filename>.log` for any pod
. Capture CR Status by running `oc describe MobileDeveloperConsole`.

==== To scale the pod

. Scale the Mobile Develper Console pod
.. Check the number of DESIRED and CURRENT replicas, and make sure that they're the same:
----
oc get deploymentconfig --selector='app=mdc'
NAME      REVISION   DESIRED   CURRENT   TRIGGERED BY
mdc       3          1         1         config,image(mdc-imagestream:1.1.4),image(mdc-oauth-proxy-imagestream:latest)
----
If they're not, this may indicate a problem with the ability to scale up (capacity, missing images, etc), or the ability to scale down (a node where a pod was scheduled might be in trouble etc.).
.. Scale the replication controller if more pods are desired by running `oc scale deploymentconfig --selector='app=mdc' --replicas=X` where X is the number of desired pods.

== Validate

=== Installation

Following these steps to ensure that the installation completed as expected.

. Switch to the Mobile Developer Console namespace by running `oc project <namespace>`  E.g `oc project mobile-developer-console`.
. Check that the link:./deploy/crds/mdc_v1alpha1_mobiledeveloperconsole_cr.yaml[MobileDeveloperConsole CR] is deployed in the same namespace as the operator by running `oc get MobileDeveloperConsole`.

[source,shell]
----
$ oc get MobileDeveloperConsole

mdc                         9d
----
+
+
IMPORTANT: This CR instructs the operator to install and configure the Database and Service pods.
+

+
. Check if there are at least 2 pods running in the namspace (Server and Operator) by running `oc get pods`. Following an example of the expected result.
+
----
$ oc get pods
NAME                                                    READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

+
[source,shell]
----
$ oc get route | grep mdc-mdc-proxy
mdc-mdc-proxy   https://<route-name>-mobile-developer-console.apps.<cluster-route>             mdc-mdc-proxy   <all>     edge/None     None

=== Optional configurations

==== Monitor

If the https://github.com/aerogear/mobile-developer-console-operator#monitoring-service-metrics[Monitoring Service (Metrics)] is enabled for the installation, a Grafana Dashboard titled `MDC Application`, and the Prometheus Monitoring instance are created.
